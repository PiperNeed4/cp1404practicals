# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimates were usually mostly accurate with a margin of error of about 10%.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I found that bigger tasks would often result in my estimates being much less accurate and as
a result my overall accuracy decreased over the course of the subject.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learnt that I am able to quickly do programming work as I often completed everything required in under
the estimated time.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Unfortunately throughout the duration of the subject only one pull request I have sent to another student has had feedback
provided so my ability to learn from reviews is limited. From what little information I have gained I have come to 
the conclusion that I need to carefully look over my code before submission to check for obvious mistakes.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I have learnt about other people's style of coding. I have also learnt that I am often too presumptuous in passing
judgement over what I think are mistakes in the code which are actually perfectly valid.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[https://github.com/ewabuczkowska/cp1404practicals/pull/5#discussion_r1855326151]()

### Explanation

I consider this review to be the best that I have done as I was able to provide polite, concise and accurate feedback 
which highlighted some mistakes the code author was grateful to have pointed out.

### Good Code Review 2

[https://github.com/dylanryder708/cp1404practicals/pull/3#event-15240025385]()

### Explanation

While this review has some shortcomings, such as the fact that I marked a valid style of docstring as a mistake,
I was able to politely identify some errors which aided the code author.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would reduce the amount of long tasks required and replace them with multiple smaller tasks totaling the same 
average completion time as I believe that people learn better when concepts are divided into smaller chunks.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I was able to consistently achieve full functionality for the required tasks in the practicals. I was able to send
in each practical in a timely manner, often sending them in multiple days before the due date.
